# ENO-YEK Luxury Brand Project

This is a Next.js project for a luxury mystery product brand called ENO-YEK. The brand sells a premium black box containing a necklace with NFC chip, a matte black card, and a welcome note. The site follows a minimalist, mysterious aesthetic with subtle animations and effects.

## Aesthetic Direction
- Clean, brutalist luxury design language
- Black background with minimal white/gray text
- Subtle serif typography for headings, light sans-serif for body
- Mysterious, enigmatic visual effects and subtle animations
- Abundant negative space for a premium feel
- Microinteractions that enhance the mysterious brand experience

## Technical Considerations
- Maintain strict mobile-first responsive design
- Use Tailwind CSS exclusively for all styling
- Keep animations subtle, elegant, and purposeful
- Maintain strict typographic hierarchy
- Focus on clean, minimal code with proper TypeScript typing
- Use CSS custom properties when extending Tailwind

## Brand Voice
- Mysterious, reserved, exclusive
- Minimal text - every word has purpose
- Cryptic messaging that creates intrigue
- Avoid excessive marketing language
- Use negative space as part of the communication strategy

## Components
- GlitchText: Creates subtle text distortion effects
- DustEffect: Adds subtle floating particles in the background
- CountdownTimer: Shows time remaining in a minimal format
- FAQAccordion: Minimal, elegant accordion for information
